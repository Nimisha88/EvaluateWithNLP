## Software, Firmware and Hardware

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* NodeJS v14.17.3 and latest version of following packages:
  * express, body-Parser, cors, dotenv
  * babel, css-loader, style-loader, mini-css-extract
  * clean-webpack, html-webpack
  * node-fetch, form-data
  * jest, webpack, workbox
  * css-minimizer, terser


## Installation instructions

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Download the application locally and do the following:
  * Obtain an APIKey at [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) by creating a free account.
  * Obtain an APIKey at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) by creating a free account.
  * In the main application folder, create `.env` file and add your APIKey like
    ```
    MeaningCloudAPIKey=your-api-key-here
    NewsAPIKey=your-api-key-here
    ```
* On terminal, `cd` to the main application folder containing `package.json` and install dependencies by running `npm install`


## Application access

* **Test Application**: To run the Jest Tests, run command `npm run test` from the main application folder (containing `package.json`)

* **Development Mode**: To run application in Development Mode, run following commands from the main application folder (containing `package.json`):
  ```
  npm run dev
  npm run server
  ```
  DevServer should automatically spins the application at http://localhost:9090/. It is configured to proxy to Node Server listening at 8080 to serve API data requests.

  *Note*: Webpack dev server does NOT write static files in `dist`, it serves the bundle virtually from the memory. `dist` will be created but will be empty in the development mode. [Read more](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48936567/webpack-dev-server-does-not-place-bundle-in-dist)

* **Prod mode**: To run application in Production Mode, run following commands from the main application folder (containing `package.json`):
  ```
  npm run prod
  npm run server
  ```
  Initiate the application manually using url http://localhost:8080/

  *Note*: Webpack will write static files in `dist`. `dist` will be created with required webpack bundle files.

## Limitation and Scope
