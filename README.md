# Coupled - Extract Topics and Top Headlines

A web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on News Articles to extract relevant topics and display their related Top Headlines.


## Software, Firmware and Hardware

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* NodeJS v14.17.3 and latest version of following packages:
  * express, body-Parser, cors, dotenv
  * babel, css-loader, style-loader, mini-css-extract
  * clean-webpack, html-webpack
  * node-fetch, form-data
  * jest, webpack, workbox
  * css-minimizer, terser


## Installation instructions

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Install NodeJS packages using following command lines:
  `npm install`
* Download the application locally and do the following:
  * Obtain an APIKey at [MeaningCloud](https://www.meaningcloud.com/) by creating a free account.
  * Obtain an APIKey at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) by creating a free account.
  * In the main application folder, create `.env` file and add your APIKey like
    ```MeaningCloudAPIKey=your-api-key-here
    NewsAPIKey=your-api-key-here
    ```
* On terminal, `cd` to the main application folder containing `package.json` and install dependencies by running `npm install`
* Application is configured with 4 scripts:
  * **Jest Test**: Run Jest tests with command `npm run test`
  * **Server**: Spin a NodeJS Server to serve application's api requests with command `npm run server`
  * **Dev mode (with Dev Server)**: Run Webpack DevServer with command `npm run dev`
  * **Prod mode**: Run Webpack in production mode with command `npm run build`


## Application access

  * **Development Mode**: Webpack DevServer automatically spins the app at http://localhost:9090/. It is configured to proxy requests to the NodeJS Server for application's api requests.
  * **Production Mode**: Initiate the application using url http://localhost:8080/
  * **NOTE**: It is important to run the NodeJS server using command `npm run server` to fetch API data upon request.


## Folder Structure

* main
  * README.md - Read me file
  * .gitignore - Files that were ignored in commit
  * package.json - Contains list of installable dependencies needed to run the application locally
  * webpack.config.js - Contains Webpack configurations
  * server/server.js - Server side scripting to handle API requests asynchronously
  * src/client
    * views/index.html - Landing page of the application
